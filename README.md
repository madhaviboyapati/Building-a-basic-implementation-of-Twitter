# Building-a-basic-implementation-of-Twitter
This is tasked with building a basic replica of Twitter on top of Google App Engine.Users should be able to follow other users on the application. They should also be able to see which users are following them. Finally they should see a timeline of the most recent 50 tweets of who they are following (including their own tweets) in reverse chronological order. It should also be possible for users to edit and delete their tweets and to create tweets that have an image attached to them in either JPEG or PNG format.
